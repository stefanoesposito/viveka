# Vivekacudamani

Vivekacudamani is a web application that allows users to easily search through the sutras in a JSON dataset using a filter function. The project is built using React, and it fetches the JSON data from an internal JSON file. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a search bar that filters the sutras based on user input.

One unique feature of Vivekacudamani is its ability to save the user's scroll position. This means that when the user closes the application and returns later, they can pick up right where they left off without needing to scroll through the sutras again. This functionality is implemented using local storage in the user's web browser.

To get started with Vivekacudamani, simply clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the project locally. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, and there are comments throughout the codebase to help you understand how everything works.

Overall, Vivekacudamani is a powerful and user-friendly tool for exploring the sutras in the JSON dataset, and its scroll position saving feature makes it even more convenient to use. Whether you're a student of philosophy or just someone curious about ancient wisdom, Vivekacudamani is sure to provide valuable insights and inspiration.
